# HackRU Fall 24
# Overview
This project visualizes NJ TRANSIT data to map one of the largest transportation systems in the United States, focusing on geospatial data for rail lines, light rail lines, and bus routes throughout New Jersey. NJ TRANSIT operates:
- 11 commuter rail lines, 3 light rail lines, and 253 bus routes.
- A network of rail cars, light rail cars, and buses, connecting over 133 million passengers annually.

- Using NJ TRANSIT’s open datasets, our map interface displays key transit points, such as rail and light rail stations or notable bus stops, giving users a tool for exploring transit access and planning routes where data is available.
# Features
- **Interactive Map**: A detailed map showing NJ TRANSIT’s rail and light rail stations, bus terminals, and key stops across New Jersey.
- **Geospatial Data Display**: Coordinates are mapped to visualize transit points, assisting users with navigation and transit planning.
# How to Run the Project 
- **Install Dependencies**: Follow instructions to install required libraries, e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt
- **Launch the Application**: Run map.py to start the server and load the map interface.
